      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        PawMatch is a non-profit animal shelter that helps abandoned and rescued pets find their
        forever families. We believe in compassion, care, and second chances. Here, every wagging
        tail tells a story of hope.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        PawMatch Shelter was founded in 2017 by a small group of animal lovers who couldn’t walk
        past abandoned pets on the streets of Almaty. What started as a small backyard rescue for a
        few stray dogs quickly grew into a full-fledged shelter, home to hundreds of animals. Over
        the years, more than <b>1200 dogs and cats</b> have found their forever homes thanks to our
        volunteers and kind donors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, PawMatch operates as a non-profit organization dedicated to providing medical care,
        food, and a safe temporary home for abandoned and injured animals. Our shelter is located in
        a peaceful green area near the mountains — a place filled with warmth, barking, and purring.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Care</h2>
      <p>
        Every animal that comes to PawMatch receives medical examination, vaccination, and, if
        necessary, rehabilitation before being put up for adoption. Our volunteers spend hours
        walking the dogs, cleaning their enclosures, and helping them regain trust in people.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that love heals. Many of our animals come from difficult circumstances — rescued
        from the streets, abusive owners, or even disaster zones. With time, care, and patience,
        they become happy, social, and ready to meet their new families.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Community</h2>
      <p>
        PawMatch is run by a team of <b>25 volunteers</b>, veterinarians, and coordinators who work
        tirelessly every day. In partnership with local clinics and schools, we organize events and
        educational programs about kindness, adoption, and responsible pet ownership.
